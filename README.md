1. **Interactive AI Chat Sessions**: Users can engage in interactive chat sessions with an AI model, allowing them to ask questions about legal matters and receive clear, understandable responses. The AI is designed to only answer questions related to law and legal issues, ensuring relevance and accuracy.

2. **Memory Update and Chat History**: The system includes the ability to update the AI's memory, enhancing its responses over time. Additionally, it saves chat histories, enabling users to review past interactions and maintain continuity in their inquiries.

3. **Translation to Local Languages**: The web app provides translations of the AI responses into any local language of India, making legal information accessible to non-native speakers and those in rural areas.

By integrating these features, our solution aims to bridge the communication gap in the legal system, making justice more accessible and understandable to everyone, regardless of their educational or linguistic background. This approach ensures that legal information is both clear and legally accurate, facilitating better understanding and empowerment for individuals across diverse communities.
